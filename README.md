## My Role in the project
### Design
I've always wanted the opportunity to explore the implementation of interactive terrain in games. Especially after being impressed by the [interactive snow scene of rise of the tomb raider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSYkwdlDN8s), I try to take this opportunity of this course to explore the implementation of deformable snow. In order to implement this technical attempt, we designed the core gameplay of tower defense in the snow in combination with the art's expectation of the game art style in our project.   
To combine snow deformation with the core gameplay, we designed a game mechanism that can collect snow from the the snowy ground and use it to slow down the enemy. This not only demonstrates my technical goals, but is also a mechanism to make the game unqiue and fun.
